summary: "I identify common pitfalls in instrumental variables regression and make a case for greater scrutiny in IV selection criteria. This paper includes a thorough literature review and proposes a new technique for synthesizing data from large bodies of literature using LLMs. It was written as part of the UROC Programâ€™s Summer Research Internship, where I was advised by Dr. Anna Josephson."
