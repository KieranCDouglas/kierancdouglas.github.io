summary: "This paper explores the relationships between the use of antiparasitic drug use during pregnancy on birth outcomes using data from India. Using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), I analyze surveys from India (2019-2021). I employ OLS, using normalized individual sampling weights for women aged 15â€“49 to account for heterogeneity in selection probabilities and non-response. Using birth weight as a proxy for general health at birth, I find no statistically significant association with antiparasitic use during pregnancy. Poor model performance suggests that the findings should be interpreted with caution, and uncovering true relationships requires a more controlled environment. This was a capstone project for an upper division biostatistics course I took as an undergraduate."
