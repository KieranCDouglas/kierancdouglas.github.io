summary: "We replicate and expand upon Building Nations through Shared Experiences: Evidence from African Football. This paper examines whether collective experiences foster the construction of national identity by analyzing the impact of national football victories in sub-Saharan Africa on trust, identity, and violence. We validate the original findings and extend the analysis by suggesting additional robustness checks and opportunities to apply the framework to other contexts."
